 ## The Mood app
  The idea I got to create a mood app because i always think that why we can’t save our mood as a memory then I thought to create a mood app.
The mood app which user can save their moods in app and multi user can use this app. It will save in data base with time and date.
Firstly, on screen shows that “Well Come to check your mood” Its displays “Login”, “Sign Up” and “Exit”

Signup: The signup is for new user where user have to enter the user name and password which is save in database. 
Login: After sign in mood app Its displays 
1: Add a journal entry
2: View journal entry  
3: Add your mood
4: Show the most used your mood.
5: Exit.
Add a journal entry A journal entry is just to know about your mood and then enter. It will save into database whenever your login in it shows our previous journal entries. If you want to delete your entry. Adding and deleting your moods. Moods can be added and deleted at any time
The ways of enter your journal is from normal entry and other one is filter entries mood.
The delete option is use for delete your entry from the journal entry

## Functionality
The title screen: Using the mood app Firstly it displays you about “Welcome to MOOD app:” and then Login, Register and Exit.
Log in screen: The login screen allows multiple user to login and the mood is save in database. Each user name is unique and the user name saved in database/user and Password will save at database/password.
